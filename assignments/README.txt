This is the midway milestone hi-fidelity prototype. In this prototype, users are able to complete the task of sharing new music. They are able to browse and listen to recommendations from friends, while also sharing the music they are listening to with the people we recommend. Not all features are currently implemented at this stage, but they will be soon. This prototype is confirmed to be working in Firefox and Google Chrome browsers.

ALTERNATIVE LAUNCHING METHODS

Follow the above steps beginning at step 6, where you download the apk from the URL listed. You may need to enable installation in your
device settings. Go to Settings > Security and check the box next to "Unknown Sources." A dialogue box may pop up asking you to confirm,
and you can just press OK.

HOW TO USE THE MERGE PROTOTYPE

The screen you are greeted with is the recommendations screen. Here you can browse some of the music that other people have recommended you listen to. You can swipe left and right on the album art to see what other songs are recommended and by whom. Clicking on one of these songs will start playing it and bring you to the now playing screen (no sound on the computer version).

On the now playing screen you can favorite the song, toggle play/pause, and skip to the next song. The three faces at the bottom of the screen are friends that we think would like the song you are listening to. Click and drag them into the center of the screen to share the song with them, and somebody else will take their place!

To return to the recommendations page, use the Android device's back button located along the bottom of the device.

Another thing to note: the menu options in the side bar do not work, and may even cause bugs/crashes. They are there for design, not functional use at this point.

We hope you enjoy Merge!


IN CASE OF CRASHES OR OTHER BUGS

First, don't panic! This is bound to happen while using an emulator such as this one. If Merge crashes, just go back to the apps page on the device and click on the android icon that says "Merge" to start it up again. This may or may not fix the issues you are having.
